## aiosip-agent-testing

Toying around with using aiosip for agent/scenario testing similar to how SIPp
works. Lost of stuff to do, but looking very, very promising.

Currently almost non-functional, part of a fast answer scenario is implemented,
and that requires a customized aiosip install which I haven't published yet -
its stuff I want to get upstreamed.

To run it:

    python -m scenarios.fastanswer
